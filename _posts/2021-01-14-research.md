## C-TIL Research

### Current research areas:

**Kidney immunity** – decoding the development, function and interactions of immune cells in the human kidney in health and disease. We have a particular interest in how tissue immune cells work with epithelial cells to defend the kidney from infection but play a pathogenic role in autoimmune diseases like lupus nephritis and in allograft rejection.

**Bladder immunity** – understanding the immune-epithelial-fibroblast cell circuits working during homeostasis and bladder infection.
Prostate immunity – we are studying immune cells in human prostate to generate an atlas-type resource and to find out how these cells become perturbed in cancer.

**Humoral immunity** in tissues – analysis of B cells and plasma cells (cells responsible for antibody production) within different organs, including the meninges and gastrointestinal tract.

**Macrophage function in tissues** – profile the different types of macrophages that are present in organs and their role in tissue defence and in organ homeostasis.

**Immune responses in COVID-19** – We are studying immune cells in peripheral blood, nasal and lung tissues to try and understand how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV2 and how this might contribute to pathology.
