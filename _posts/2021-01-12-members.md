John also works on multiple projects for the human cell atlas and is a member of the NIHR blood and transplant unit where he applies sequencing based methods to understand the processes which occur at the molecular level in organ perfusion which is used as a method for both testing and preserving organs prior to transplantation.</td>

		<td><b>Dr. Kelvin Tuong</b> is a computational immunologist interested in single-cell analysis of tissue resident macrophages in health and disease. He attained his PhD in macrophage cell biology and endocrinology at The University of Queensland (UQ), Australia and went on to a post-doc position with Prof. Ian Frazer (co-inventor of the Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine, UQ Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute) where he worked on HPV immunology, cervical cancer and skin cancer.  In his time in the Frazer lab, he developed an interest in bioinformatics analyses as a means to tackle and understand immunology problems in health and disease. He is now applying his skillsets in his second post-doc position with Prof. Menna Clatworthy, with a visiting appointment with the Teichmann lab, where he is primarily interested in single-cell analyses of tissue resident macrophages and lymphoid cells in kidneys and prostate.</td>

		<td><b>Dr. Mary-Ellen Lynall</b> is a psychiatrist, Medical Research Council Clinical Research Training Fellow and Bye-fellow at Christ’s College, Cambridge. After graduating with First Prize in Natural Sciences (neuroscience) at Cambridge University, she pursued graduate-entry medicine at Oxford, where she was awarded the Gold Medal for highest performance in the clinical school. Following rotations in neurology and neurosurgery as part of the Cambridge Academic Neurosciences Foundation Programme, she entered specialist training in psychiatry and was the Royal College of Psychiatrists Core Trainee of the Year 2017. Mary-Ellen uses human studies and animal models to investigate the mechanisms underlying the associations between stress, inflammation, mood and fatigue.

		<td><b>Dr. Andrew Stewart</b> is a Clinical Lecturer in renal medicine and both a Fellow and the Director of Studies for medicine at Christ’s College. Andy uses a wide variety of techniques including high resolution confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, mass spectroscopy and single cell RNA sequencing to investigate the cellular, micro-vesicle, protein and nucleic acid content of human urine in health and disease. This information allows better understanding of innate and adaptive urothelial defence systems against urinary tract infections, the roles of these processes in renal autoimmune disease and can also be used to non-invasively reveal mechanisms and biomarkers for a variety of other renal pathologies.</td>
