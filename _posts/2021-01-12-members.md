    <td><b>Dr. John Ferdinand</b> is a Senior Research associate in the lab and is interested in using transcriptomic based approaches to understand biology both in steady state and disease and runs the sequencing projects in the lab. John uses both single cell (10x genomics) and bulk sequencing methods to understand the function of the kidney and predict the long term viability of donated kidneys post transplant. John also works on multiple projects for the human cell atlas and is a member of the NIHR blood and transplant unit where he applies sequencing based methods to understand the processes which occur at the molecular level in organ perfusion which is used as a method for both testing and preserving organs prior to transplantation.</td>
