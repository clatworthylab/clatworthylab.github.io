		<td><b>Dr. John Ferdinand</b> is a Senior Research associate in the lab and is interested in using transcriptomic based approaches to understand biology both in steady state and disease and runs the sequencing projects in the lab. John uses both single cell (10x genomics) and bulk sequencing methods to understand the function of the kidney and predict the long term viability of donated kidneys post transplant. John also works on multiple projects for the human cell atlas and is a member of the NIHR blood and transplant unit where he applies sequencing based methods to understand the processes which occur at the molecular level in organ perfusion which is used as a method for both testing and preserving organs prior to transplantation.</td>

		<td><b>Dr. Kevin Loudon</b> obtained his MBBS in 2008 and has been a renal registrar in the East of England Deanery since 2012. His research interest lies in kidney-resident mononuclear phagocytes and their role in defence against infection and in tissue repair. He spent a year as a clinical research fellow funded by the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust / Isaac Newton Trust and has recently started his PhD with support from a Kidney Research UK Clinical Training Fellowship. He is currently Director of Studies in Medicine at St Edmunds College, Cambridge.</td>

		<td><b>Dr. Mary-Ellen Lynall</b> is a psychiatrist, Medical Research Council Clinical Research Training Fellow and Bye-fellow at Christ’s College, Cambridge. After graduating with First Prize in Natural Sciences (neuroscience) at Cambridge University, she pursued graduate-entry medicine at Oxford, where she was awarded the Gold Medal for highest performance in the clinical school. Following rotations in neurology and neurosurgery as part of the Cambridge Academic Neurosciences Foundation Programme, she entered specialist training in psychiatry and was the Royal College of Psychiatrists Core Trainee of the Year 2017. Mary-Ellen uses human studies and animal models to investigate the mechanisms underlying the associations between stress, inflammation, mood and fatigue. She is co-supervised by Professor Ed Bullmore (Department of Psychiatry) and Dr Menna Clatworthy (Department of Medicine).</td>
