# Clatworthy Lab Website

This repository generates the assets for https://clatworthylab.github.io website. The website is hosted on [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) and is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

It uses the `Millennial` theme, which is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/).
